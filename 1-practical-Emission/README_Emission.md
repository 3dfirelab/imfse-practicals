# IMFSE-practical UNIT 5 - WildFire Behavior Modelling - Fire Emission

This is the material for the first practical on fire emission at atmospheric scale.  
**ADD image of GFAS greece 2007 greek fire**

### Objectives:
- load and plot [GFED4](https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/fire_emissions_v4_R1.html) data.
- load and plot [GFAS](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-fire-emissions-gfas?tab=overview) data
- observation of fire Season Emission
- accessing active fire data.
- assess the impact of the fire of El pont de vilomara in the Spanish and Catalan fire season emission.

### Technical Requirements: 
You need a jupyterlab environment running to run the two notebooks of the practical:
- [1-GFED/load_GFED_data_example.ipynb](./1-GFED/load_GFED_data_example.ipynb)
- [2-GFAS/load_GFAS_data_example.ipynb](./2-GFAS/load_GFAS_data_example.ipynb)  

See [README.md](../README.md) to use one available on andromeda UPC server.  

### Notebook Structure and **Deliverable**
Each notebook is structure with first a section where you can follow the code, helping you accessing and plotting the data. A second section ask you questions to help you go further into the data. Finally a last section ask you questions that you should answer in a small reports to deliver at the end of the practical, Reports are made by groups of two.
